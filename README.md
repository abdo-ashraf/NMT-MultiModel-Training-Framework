---

## Usage
### 1. Prepare Your Dataset:
   You can use your custom dataset or generate data using the following command:
   ```bash
   make data data_type=1 out_dir=./out
   ```
   Currently, the available `data_type` options are:
   - `"en-ar": 1` (English to Arabic)
   - `"en-sp": 2` (English to Spanish)

   The generated data will be stored in `/out_dir/data/`.
   
### 2. Prepare Tokenizer Configurations:
   
   Modify the configuration file at: `/Configurations/tokenizer_config.json` to specify tokenizer settings such as vocabulary size, special tokens, and tokenization method.

### 3. Tokenizer Training:
   Train a SentencePiece tokenizer on the training dataset using the following command:
   ```bash
   make tokenizer \
      train_csv_path=/out/data/en-ar_train.csv \
      train_col1=ar train_col2=en \
      tokenizer_config_path=/Configurations/tokenizer_config.json \
      out_dir=./out
   ```
   This command trains a tokenizer using the specified training dataset (`train_csv_path`) and columns (`train_col1` and `train_col2`). The tokenizer's configuration (e.g., vocabulary size, special tokens) is defined in `tokenizer_config.json`, and the trained tokenizer is saved in the `out_dir/tokenizers/` directory.

### 4. Prepare Model Configurations:
   
   Before training your NMT model, you can customize its architecture and hyperparameters by modifying the configuration file located at: `/Configurations/model_config.json` This file contains default values for all parameters, which are pre-configured to work well for most use cases. However, you can adjust these settings based on your specific requirements or leave them as their default values if you prefer.

   Here's an example configuration based on the parameters defined in the `/Configurations/model_config.json` file:
   ```json
   {
       "dim_embed": 256,
       "dim_model": 256,
       "dim_feedforward": 1024,
       "num_layers": 4,
       "dropout": 0.1,
       "maxlen": 512,
       "flash_attention": false
   }
   ```

   Explanation of Parameters:
   - `dim_embed`: The dimensionality of the token embeddings, which maps input tokens to dense vectors.
   - `dim_model`: The dimensionality of the model's hidden states, determining the size of the encoder and decoder layers.
   - `dim_feedforward`: The dimensionality of the feedforward network's inner layer within the Transformer architecture.
   - `num_layers`: The number of layers in both the encoder and decoder stacks.
   - `dropout`: The dropout rate to prevent overfitting during training.
   - `maxlen`: The maximum sequence length for input and output tokens, ensuring consistent tensor shapes.
   - `flash_attention`: A boolean flag to enable or disable Flash Attention, an optimized attention mechanism for faster training on supported hardware.
     
   **Note**: Flash Attention is not yet available for use and will be added in a future update.

Adjust these parameters based on your dataset size, computational resources, and desired model performance. Once configured, the framework will use these settings to initialize and train your NMT model.

### 5. Prepare Training Configurations:

   Before starting the training process for your Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model, you need to define the training settings in the configuration file located at `/Configurations/training_config.json`. This file includes several hyperparameters and options that control the training pipeline, such as learning rate, batch size, optimization settings, evaluation frequency, and more.

   Here's an example configuration based on the parameters defined in the `/Configurations/training_config.json` file:
   ```json
   {
   "learning_rate": 1e-3,
   "max_steps": 6000,
   "seed": 123,
   "precision": "high",
   "device": "cuda",
   "batch_size": 128,
   "cpu_num_workers": 4,
   "weight_decay": 1e-05,
   "onnx": false,
   "run_name": "en-ar_s2s",
   "pin_memory": true,
   "warmup_steps": 1000,
   "torch_compile": false,
   "eval_steps": 500,
   "lr_decay_ratio": 0.01
   }
   ```
   Explanation of Parameters:
   - `learning_rate`: The learning rate for model optimization.
   - `max_steps`: The total number of training steps to run.
   - `seed`: The random seed for reproducibility.
   - `precision`: The floating point precision used for training. The options are `high` or `highest`
   - `evice`: This specifies the hardware device used for training.
   - `batch_size`: The number of samples per batch during training.
   - `cpu_num_workers`: The number of CPU workers used for data loading.
   - `weight_decay`: Regularization term used to prevent overfitting.
   - `onnx`: Indicating whether to export in ONNX or pytorch format.
   - `run_name`: A name for the experiment or run.
   - `pin_memory`: Enable memory pinning during data loading.
   - `warmup_steps`: The number of steps for learning rate warmup, helping the model start training more smoothly.
   - `torch_compile`: PyTorch compilation for optimization.
   - `eval_steps`: The number of training steps between each evaluation.
   - `lr_decay_ratio`: The learning rate decay ratio.

### 6. Model Training:

   Once you have prepared your dataset, tokenizer, and configuration files, you can start training your model. To train your NMT model, use the following command:
   ```bash
   make model train_csv_path=/out/data/en-ar_train.csv \
      valid_csv_path=/out/data/en-ar_valid.csv \
      source_column_name=en \
      target_column_name=ar \
      tokenizer_path=/out/tokenizers/en-ar_tokenizer.model \
